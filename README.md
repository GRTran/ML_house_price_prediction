# House Price Prediction Code

# Features and Purpose

This code will read in house data from Rightmove given particular user criteria. The criteria for search is identical to that seen on the Rightmove website. A queried data set is then cleaned up in the best way possible, although manual data inspection may still be required. Statistical analysis is performed on the queried dataset. The code can be used from this point to simply examine properties given certain criteria that may be cheaper than the mean value for a similar property.

Features are then allocated to each house which may then be used in an ML model to attempt to price a given property.
